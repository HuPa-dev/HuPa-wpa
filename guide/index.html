            <h1>Welcome to Husky Park!</h1>
            <a>Here are some tips and guidelines for enjoying your park visit! You can also tap on the buttons below to find a map of the park, and detailed instructions for all activities.</a>
            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>No gloves when petting</h3>
                    <a>All our huskies are friendly, but some are expert glove thieves, so keep any gloves and handwarmers safe in your pocket or purse, when patting any of our huskies.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Some signs say "No petting"</h3>
                    <a>Some of our husky enclosures have a sign, that says NO PETTING. These dogs are not aggressive, but they can get excited very easily so to avoid any accidents, do not pet these dogs.</a>
                <br>
                    <a>If you have kids with you, it's best to always ask one of the guides at the park, to make sure which dogs are best for small children to interact with.</a>
                </li>

                    <h3>Be careful of slippery ground!</h3>
                    <a>Although we maintain the park daily, the snow and ice in Rovaniemi can sometimes be <strong>very</strong> slippery. Be careful, wear good shoes and avoid running.</a>
                </li>
