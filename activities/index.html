Experience memorable moments and thrill of speed sitting pulled by a husky team!

Come and see the snowy forest and bog with the beautiful view! After the safari you’ll get to see the other residents of the kennel.

With the entrance fee you can stay at the park area as long as you like, seeing the dogs and taking photos.

Each of our sleds takes 3-5 people and our guides make the final decision on how many people go to each sled.

Please note that if you make a booking for 1 person, you may have to share the sleigh with another person. Bookings for more than two people are conducted in their own sleighs.
