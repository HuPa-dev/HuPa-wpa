<h3>Meet our huskies up close 🐾</h3>
<p>
Come and get to know our lovely purebred Siberian Huskies even closer! We have a fenced area where you can pet the dogs freely and enjoy their company.
Some of these fluffy friends wants to play with you and some of them enjoy petting. Our guides give you treats that you can feed them, which they really enjoy!
Please note that all dogs are individuals, and sometimes they are not in a mood for cuddles and kisses.

<h3> Meet & Greet tips!</h3>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>No gloves for petting or feeding</h4>
        <p>Huskies curious, and very interested in gloves. They may grab them, and eating gloves is bad for them. Keep your gloves and handwarmers safe in your pockets or bag. </p>
        <p>During the winter season, the Meet & Greet area has fireplaces for warming up your hands. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>No running</h4>
        <p>Running or chasing makes huskies more excited and can confuse younger dogs. Stay calm, relaxed, and let the huskies come to you. Help us train good habits into the puppies 🐾 </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Treats: one at a time</h4>
        <p>Once the guide gives you treats, offer them <strong>one by one.</strong> Place the treat flat on your palm and lower your hand down. This helps the huskies take treats gently and keeps jumping to a minimum. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Don’t pick them up by yourself</h4>
        <p>Even if there are puppies around, don’t lift any dogs on your own. If you’d love to hold one, just ask the guide, they know which huskies are comfortable with it.</p>
