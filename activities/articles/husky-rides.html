Come and see the snowy forest and bog with the beautiful view! After the safari you’ll get to see the other residents of the kennel.
With the entrance fee you can stay at the park area as long as you like, seeing the dogs and taking photos.
Each of our sleds takes 3-5 people and our guides make the final decision on how many people go to each sled.
Please note that if you make a booking for 1 person, you may have to share the sleigh with another person. Bookings for more than two people are conducted in their own sleighs.
We have been operating next to Santa Claus Village already for several decades. We are a family owned company and we always try to pay special attention to dogs wellbeing and natural needs. In Husky Park you can see how the dogs live, from feeding to taking off the harnesses. Come and feel the traditional atmosphere and enjoy the unique surroundings.
The dogs, real Siberian Huskies are loving their life at Husky Park. They love running from all their heart and they are eagerly waiting for some petting. These magnificent creatures are absolutely amazing, come and see for yourself!
Our goal in Husky Park is that everyone enjoys themselves – the customers, staff and the dogs. We wish to provide a genuine and safe experience, assured by our professional, skilled guides. We have about 100 genuine Siberian Huskies, and we get puppies a few times a year. Welcome to enjoy wonderful experiences and charming dogs!
